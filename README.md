## Introduction

Hate crimes are a serious issue that impacts marginalized communities across the United States. These crimes not only harm individual victims but also send messages of fear and intimidation to entire groups. This project analyzes hate crimes reported in San Francisco from 2020 to 2024 using open San Francisco Data datasets. These datasets, maintained by city and county departments, aim to increase transparency and encourage data-driven solutions to social issues.

San Francisco is known for its diversity and progressive values, particularly in its LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities. However, no place is entirely free from hate crimes. This project seeks to answer key questions: Who is most at risk of experiencing hate crimes in San Francisco? Are certain communities being targeted more than others? Has the frequency of these crimes changed over time?

This project brings together both personal and academic motivations. As a Latino gay man in the Bay Area, I’m curious about the real challenges marginalized communities face in a city that prides itself on inclusivity. On the academic front, this project is a hands-on dive into data wrangling, sorting through unstructured data to find meaningful insights. My goal is to uncover patterns in hate crimes, highlight which communities are most at risk, and pinpoint the locations where crimes happen most often. In the end, I hope to answer a critical question: **How do race, sexual orientation, and location come together to determine who is most vulnerable to hate crimes in San Francisco?**

## Justification of the research

San Francisco is known for its diversity and inclusivity, but hate crimes still occur, affecting the safety and well-being of many communities. This project is important because it helps uncover who is most at risk and how these crimes have changed over time by:

**Identifying the Most Vulnerable:** Understanding which groups are most frequently targeted can provide valuable insight into the risks they face and highlight areas where more protection and support are needed.\
**Recognizing Patterns Over Time:** Looking at data from the past few years can reveal trends in hate crimes, offering a clearer picture of when and where these incidents are most likely to happen.

By exploring these patterns, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of hate crimes in San Francisco, helping to inform discussions about safety and social justice.

## Literature Review

**WORK IN PROGRESS SECTION**

This section is still being developed. It will explore the definition and history of hate crimes, as well as the communities most affected by them, using references from the "References" section. Additionally, it will incorporate San Francisco Census Data to compare the city's demographic makeup with the groups most targeted by hate crimes. This comparison will help determine whether the most affected communities reflect the overall population distribution or if certain groups are disproportionately impacted.

The section will also include news reports from January 2022, which provide important context about the spike in Anti-Asian hate crimes in 2021. These sources will help explain the social and political factors that may have contributed to the surge in reported incidents, setting the stage for further research.

## Notebooks

## Conclusion

This research explored hate crime trends in San Francisco from 2020 to 2024, focusing on the intersection of race, sexual orientation, and location to determine who is most vulnerable to these crimes. By analyzing open data from the San Francisco Police Department, I identified patterns in victim demographics, crime locations, and yearly fluctuations in hate crime incidents.

The findings highlight 2021 as the peak year for hate crimes, with a total of 96 victims, significantly higher than any other year. This increase was seen across both race-based and sexual orientation-based hate crimes, suggesting that external social or political factors may have contributed to heightened tensions during that period.

Race-based hate crimes were the most commonly reported type each year, with Asian individuals being the most frequent targets. Black and Hispanic communities also faced consistent levels of hate crimes, but the spike in Anti-Asian crimes stood out as the most significant trend.

Hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ individuals occurred every year, reinforcing that San Francisco, despite its reputation as an inclusive city, is not free from homophobia. Gay men were the most at-risk group, experiencing 17 reported incidents in 2021 and 13 in 2024. Anti-Lesbian crimes appeared in the data less frequently, but this does not necessarily mean they occur less, it may indicate underreporting.

Location plays a key role in determining risk levels. The data revealed that public streets and transit areas are the most common locations for both Anti-Asian and Anti-Gay (Male) hate crimes. This suggests that individuals in these groups are most vulnerable when navigating public spaces, where they are more exposed to strangers.

Based on assault reports data, I identified 24th St & Osage Aly as the most dangerous intersection for assaults, along with several high-crime areas such as Mission Street, Market Street, and the Tenderloin. If hate crimes are concentrated in these same high-assault areas, it could suggest that certain communities are at risk simply because they live or travel through areas where violence is more common. However, if hate crimes occur in different locations, it would indicate that these crimes are not just random acts of violence but targeted attacks against specific groups in certain spaces.

Based on this research, the highest-risk group for hate crimes in San Francisco is Asian individuals and gay men, particularly in public spaces like streets, transit hubs, and nightlife areas. The intersection of identity (race, sexual orientation) and location determines who is most at risk and where they are most likely to experience hate crimes.

## Next Steps

While this study provides valuable insights into how race, sexual orientation, and location intersect to determine who is most vulnerable to hate crimes in San Francisco, there are several ways to build on this research to gain an even deeper understanding. Expanding the scope of analysis, incorporating additional data sources, and exploring new angles could help answer remaining questions and strengthen findings.

**Ongoing monitoring of hate crime trends**

This analysis covers hate crimes from 2020 to 2024, but patterns of violence can shift over time due to changes in social attitudes, political events, or policy measures. A long-term study could reveal whether certain years consistently see spikes in hate crimes or if certain communities experience worsening conditions over time. Continuous monitoring would help determine if 2021 was an anomaly or part of a larger trend, and whether efforts to address hate crimes are making a measurable impact.

**Investigating underreporting of hate crimes**

This research found that hate crimes against LGBTQ+ individuals, especially lesbians, were reported at much lower rates than those against other groups. However, this does not necessarily mean fewer incidents occur, it could indicate that many crimes go unreported. A deeper investigation into barriers to reporting, such as lack of police trust or social stigma, would provide a clearer picture of the true scope of the problem. 

**Exploring the connection between social/political events and hate crime surges**

The 2021 peak in hate crimes suggests that external social or political factors may have influenced the rise in violence. Future research could examine media coverage, political rhetoric, policy changes, protests, or national/international events to see how they correlate with increases in hate crimes. 

**Comparing hate crime locations to general assault hotspots**

By comparing the most dangerous intersections for general assaults to hate crime locations, this research could determine whether hate crimes occur in places that already experience high levels of violence or if they are happening in different locations, suggesting targeted attacks. This step would help answer whether hate crimes are simply a reflection of existing crime trends or if they indicate deliberate targeting of vulnerable communities in specific spaces.

**Final thoughts**

Expanding this research will provide a clearer, more detailed picture of hate crime risks in San Francisco. By tracking trends over time, mapping high-risk areas, investigating underreporting, and analyzing the impact of political events, future studies can move beyond identifying patterns to understanding the deeper causes behind hate crimes and their long-term consequences.
