# Mapping Vulnerability: Understanding Hate Crime Trends in San Francisco (2020-2024)

Introduction

Hate crimes are a serious issue that impacts marginalized communities across the United States. These crimes not only harm individual victims but also send messages of fear and intimidation to entire groups. This project analyzes hate crimes reported in San Francisco from 2020 to 2024 using open San Francisco Data datasets. These datasets, maintained by city and county departments, aim to increase transparency and encourage data-driven solutions to social issues.

San Francisco is known for its diversity and progressive values, particularly in its LGBTQ+ and immigrant communities. However, no place is entirely free from hate crimes. This project seeks to answer key questions: Who is most at risk of experiencing hate crimes in San Francisco? Are certain communities being targeted more than others? Has the frequency of these crimes changed over time?

This project brings together both personal and academic motivations. As a Latino gay man in the Bay Area, Iâ€™m curious about the real challenges marginalized communities face in a city that prides itself on inclusivity. On the academic front, this project is a hands-on dive into data wrangling, sorting through unstructured data to find meaningful insights. My goal is to uncover patterns in hate crimes, highlight which communities are most at risk, and pinpoint the locations where crimes happen most often. In the end, I hope to answer a critical question: How do race, sexual orientation, and location come together to determine who is most vulnerable to hate crimes in San Francisco?
